===================================
 Legion Python toolchain container
===================================

Main aim of this container - to provide you a way to run your model training on local machine.

1. To run jupyter lab use "jupyter lab" command
2. To run jupyter notebook use "jupyter notebook" command
3. To run custom python script use "python3 <script>"

During training you have to call legion.model functions and call legion.model.save() at the end of script.
After legion.model.save() invocation your binary-serialized models will be stored inside container file-system.
To make docker-image from your model you have to run "legionctl build" inside your container.
