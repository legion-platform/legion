In terms of Legion, model may be in next stages:

1. Source code of model, placed in supported VCS (Version Control System)

2. ``Trained Model Binary``, that is trained by ``Toolchain Train Integration``, from source code.

3. ``Packed Model`` (in range of formats), that is packed by ``Toolchain Packaging Integration`` from ``Trained Model Binary``.
