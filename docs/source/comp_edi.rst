- Managing (installation / removal / configuration) of :term:`Toolchain Train Integrations <Toolchain Train Integration>`
- Managing (installation / removal / configuration) of :term:`Toolchain Packaging Integrations <Toolchain Packaging Integration>`
- Making :term:`predictions <prediction>`
- Gathering and providing :term:`prediction feedbacks <Prediction Feedback>`
- Managing (installation / removal / configuration) of :term:`Toolchain Train Integrations <Toolchain Train Integration>`

How to reach EDI in target cluster
----------------------------------

By default, :term:`EDI` service is available on URL ``edi.<cluster-name>``, where ``<cluster name>`` is target cluster's base URL (e.g. ``edi.my-cluster.lab.university.com``. But this address can be configured during Legion's HELM chart installation.

What URLs does it provide
-------------------------

All information about URLs that :term:`EDI` provides can be viewed using auto generated, interactive Swagger (OpenAPI) documentation web page, located at ``<edi-address>/swagger/index.html``. You can read all up-to-date documentation and invoke all methods (allowed for your account) right on this webpage.


Implementation details
----------------------

:term:`EDI` is a HTTP REST API server, written using GoLang. For easily integration it provides swagger endpoint with up-to-date protocol information.

Authentication and authorization
--------------------------------

:term:`EDI` analyzes incoming HTTP headers for JWT token, extracts client's scopes from this token and approves / declines incoming requests based on these (provided in JWT) scopes.
