Security
===================

Legion delegates user, token and credential management to third-party providers.

Any service that supports the OAuth2 protocol can be used to provide authentication and authorization to a Legion cluster.

.. warning::

    Connectivity from cluster to OAuth2 IP (identity provider) is required.

Legion integrations OAuth2 IdP using the ``oauth2_proxy`` library.

Securing model APIs
-----

:term:`Model prediction API` and :term:`Model Feedback API` calls are secured using :term:`JWT tokens <JWT Token>`.
:term:`EDI` services can issue a new :term:`JWT token` for a given :term:`role name <Model Deployment Access Role Name>`.
:term:`JWT tokens <JWT Token>` are scoped to specific :term:`role names <Model Deployment Access Role Name>` and may be used for granting access to the :term:`Model prediction API`.
The role name has to be defined during creation of :term:`model deployments <Model Deploying>`, otherwise default value will be used.

Securing management APIs
-----

When enabled in the Legion start-up configuration, all other endpoints (such as :term:`EDI`) are secured using :term:`JWT tokens <JWT Token>` and OAuth2 cookies.
When a user tries to open a secured resource, ``oauth2_proxy`` checks the incoming request for a :term:`JWT token<JWT Token>` and OAuth2 Cookies.
If request does not contain appropriate credentials, the user will be redirected to a login sceen.

Securing network connections, ingress and egress
-----
Legion does not ship with network policies enabled, but any policy that uses Pod label selection can be used (e.g. K8S NetworkPolicy). Details are in the Network Connectivity Reference.
